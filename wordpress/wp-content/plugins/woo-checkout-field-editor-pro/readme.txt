== Frequently Asked Questions ==
=Is there a possible way to provide a validation other than the predefined validations provided like email, phone etc?=
The free version doesn’t provide the feature to create custom validators, but with the Checkout Field Editor for WooCommerce pro version of the plugin, custom validators can be defined based on regular expressions.

</ol>

The style defined in the class will be applied to the default and custom fields for which this class is included.

=Can I apply price for the fields created using this plugin?=
No, the free version of the plugin doesn’t support the Price feature. With the premium version, you can use 5 different price types.

=How to make the no options selected for the Select field by default?=
By default, the First value of the Select field will be selected. For making the field selected with no options, enter a Pipe symbol(|)  before all the options. Enter all the other options after this pipe separated by each other.
