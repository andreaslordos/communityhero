				<strong>Warning!</strong> Do not complete any deliveries without following these guidelines!
			</div>
			
			<h2>Health Guidelines</h2>
			<p>Not every COVID-19 carrier is symptomatic, and we cannot completely eliminate risk. With that in mind, we have implemented the following safety guidelines to minimize any potential transmission of the novel coronavirus. </p>
			<p>All community heroes confirm that they:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Have not traveled out of the country in the last 14 days</li>
				<li>Are not exhibiting any signs of compromised health (e.g. runny nose, cough, fever, etc.)</li>
				<li>Have not come in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 14 days </li>
				<li>Have been practicing social distancing</li>
			</ul>

			<p>We ask all community heroes wear latex/rubber gloves during deliveries. We also recommend that community heroes avoid touching unnecessary items and utilize a self-checkout option if available. Volunteers are additionally requested to take every government measure, including, <b>but not limited to</b>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Washing hands frequently with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds or using hand sanitizer</li>
				<li>Refraining from touching their face after having been outside</li>
				<li>Sneezing or coughing into their elbow</li>
			</ul>
			Practicing "social distancing" &mdash; staying indoors, avoiding crowds, staying 2 meters away from other people if you have to go outside
			

			<h2>Delivery Protocol</h2>
			
			<p>Volunteers make as minimal contact with the recipient as possible upon delivery:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>They will place items at the door and knock/ring the doorbell and/or call the recipient to inform them that their order has been delivered.</li>
				<li>Payment may differ by city. Payment to the volunteer will be exchanged either via cash, check, Credit Card over the phone, or Paypal/Venmo/Cash App/Zelle if the senior has access to those applications.</li>
			</ul>
			
			
			
			
			<h4>Thank you for following these guidelines and for being a Community Hero.</h4>
			<h4>By clicking on the button below, you agree to follow the guidelines as best you can.</h4>
			<button id='agree-button' class="btn btn-primary">Proceed to order details</button>
